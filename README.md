Here‚Äôs a revised `README.md` file tailored for your Expo project, built using `pnpm`, but with clear instructions for users who might not have `pnpm` installed:

#  Welcome to Travel Bucket List App

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). It uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) as the package manager for faster and more efficient dependency management.

---

##  Get Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Using `pnpm` (recommended):

```bash
pnpm install
```

> üí° Don't have `pnpm` installed?
> You can install it globally using `npm`:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Or, use `npm` directly:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App

```bash
npx expo start
```

You‚Äôll be given options to open the app in:

* A [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
* [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
* [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
* [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) ‚Äî a sandboxed environment for quick testing
